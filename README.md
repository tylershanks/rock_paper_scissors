# Rock Paper Scissors

Project from TheOdinProject

The Rock Paper Scissors project was about 50/50 Javascript and CSS.

My main focus on this project was to get the game to work 100%, which it does.

The Javascript and DOM manipulation was the main focus here. The buttons were difficult to have them appear and disappear but I was able to figure
it out and implement it in a way that works really well.
